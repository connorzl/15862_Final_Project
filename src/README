Non-photorealistic Rendering Pipeline


1. initializeBrushStrokes.m
Provide an img_name, wr, wb. wr must be < wb.
Run initializeBrushStrokes

2. orientation.m
Change img_name, wb to be same as in step 1.
Set useGradientShop to true/false for using long-edge detector (GradientShop) or local edges (original).
If using gradientshop, proceed to step 2a.
Modify thresh until numStrong for each layer is around between 100 and 200.
Run orientation

2a. longEdgeDetector.m
Change img_name to be same as in step 1.
Run longEdgeDetector

3. edgeClipping.m
Change img_name, wb to be same as in step 1.
Run edgeClipping

4. colorExtraction.m
Change img_name to be same as in step 1.
Run colorExtraction

5. rendering.m
Change img_name, wb to be same as in step 1.
Change useAlpha to true if one wants to use alpha compositing, false otherwise.
Run rendering
